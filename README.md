## The LIRC remote configurations project.

Imported from http://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/code/ci/master/tree/ using https://import.github.com/

The LIRC project is about managing IR remotes. For each remote used, there
should be a configuration file. This project manages these files.

The configurations here should be usable in current [LIRC](http://sf.net/p/lirc) versions and also in [winLIRC](http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes). However, the real purpose of this project is to provide a better foundation for configuration tools. These tools are introduced in the 0.9.2 version.

The documentation for lirc-remotes is in the [project wiki](http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki)

The remotes database can be browsed [here](remotes-table.html).

There is also a simple CSV index file available as [remotes.list](remotes.list). This format is not stable.
